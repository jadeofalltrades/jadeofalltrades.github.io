      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>UX/UI</li>
        <li>Brand Development</li>
        <li>Visual Design</li>
        <li>User Testing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>InVision</li>
        <li>Google Forms</li>
        <li>Pen & Paper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Honeycomb is meant to address the problem of cloud storage services that are too hard to organize, aesthetically unappealing, and constantly asking users to sign up for premium memberships just to get more storage space. </p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <h4>Honeycomb</h4>
        <p>This is Honeycomb. It has similarities to other cloud storage solutions, in that user can create whatever documents they want, or upload their own files. It is different in that the onus of organization is not put on the user–a frequent pain point among users surveyed.</p>
        <p>It also gives users a lot of options for storage. Even though the majority of users use cloud storage for making documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, there are many who take notes, store photos, and create boards as well.</p>
        <p>Many users use multiple apps to achieve this. With Honeycomb, users can create different save destinations for all their different media, and organization happens first, so nothing gets lost.</p>

    <section class="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery & Research</h2>
        <h3>Survey:Key Results<h3>
          <ul class="results">
            <li>70% of users say they use cloud storage for personal use, rather than work or school.</li>
            <li>30% of users use cloud storage for work, school, and personal use, but have to use different applications.</li>
            <li>40% of users say difficulty organizing is their biggest frustration.</li>
            <li>85% of users say being able to upload content from their computers is a must.</li>
            <li>80% of users need to share their documents and collaborate with friends and colleagues.</li>
            <li>75% of users say they need lots of options for storage and organization</li>
            <li>75% of users want their service to be free to use.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Survey: Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Research showed user frustration with: organizing, features, and cost. It also indicated that users wanted a service that gives them lots of options for storage, upload content from multiple devices, share and collaborate on content, and of course, is free to use. I let this data guide my decisions, because I wanted to make something that solved my users’ specific problems.</p>
          <h3>Personas</h3>
            <p>I interviewed some users to see what motivates them, and developed  personas to help guide my choices.</p>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/persona1mobile.png" alt="picture of woman smiling"/>
              <p>Marissa is always looking for new content on the web. She is frustrated by unfriendly UIs and poor organization, and would love an application that made sharing and saving easy to use, and easy to look at. </p>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/persona2mobile.png" alt="picture of man smiling"/>
              <p>Colby is a student always eager to collaborate on a project. He doesn’t like to spend a ton of time combing through his cloud for files, and just wants one app for all his sharing and storage needs.</p>
          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/pinterest.png" alt="Pinterest badge"/>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/gdrive.png" alt="Google Drive badge"/>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/evernote.png" alt="Evernote badge"/>
          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Pinterest, while not a typical “cloud storage solution” does save user’s information in the cloud, and is a popular method of saving and sharing content on the Internet. While users are limited in the content they can create with Pinterest, saved content is organized in a snap.</p>
            <p>The strongest competitor I researched, Google Drive offers users the most in content creation and storage space, and while organization is easy to accomplish, users need to actively engage in organizing their files.</p>
            <p>Evernote follows a freemium model, and while the notetaking and content saving app does offer key functionality, the normal non-paying regular user would not find the free membership to be useful in the long term.</p>

      <h2>Information Architechture</h2>
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
          <ul class="user-stories">
            <li>As a user I want to make an account so that I can start saving my files.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to save content to the app from my computer so my files are saved in the cloud</li>
            <li>As a user I want to organize content into folders so I can add files to current projects.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to make a text document.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to easily search for files so I can find them quickly when I need them.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to share content by link so that people who don’t have the app can see my work.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to share content through the app so people on my team can see my work.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to save photos to the app from my phone so I can add photographs to my projects.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to save Internet content to the app from my phone so that I can save interesting pages and articles.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to upgrade my account to premium so that I can have more space.</li>
            <li>As a user I want to see my notifications so that I know when my team is communicating with me.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
            <p>After determining what user stories would make up my MVP I set out to map the user flows, first on paper, and then in Figma. During this process I decided that the simplest way to satisfy user goals would be to incorporate modal screens into my design.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/userflow.png" alt="example of user flow"/>
                <figcaption>In this flow, users are saving photos to the app from their phone. </figcaption>
              </figure>
          <h3>Sketches & Wireframes</h3>
            <p>I started sketching my ideas out onto paper for rapid iteration.  When I was happy with them, I moved into Figma to draw up quick wireframes for prototyping. </p>

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <h4>What I tested</h4>
              <p>Users were asked to make an account, create a piece of content, and then organize that piece of content.</p>
            <h4>What I learned<h4>
              <p>Users had difficulty differentiating between the login and signup flow. Some icons were difficult for users to understand without labels. </p>
            <h4>Changes I made to my design<h4>
              <p>In later iterations I completely separated the login and signup flows on the homepage and reorganized the page hierarchy to prioritize the signup. I also made sure every icon was assigned a label.</p>

    <section class="brand">
      <h2>Brand Development<h2>
        <p>For branding, I took a look at both my target market (females 25-34) and my competitors to see what would appeal to users. After thinking a lot about possible names, I settled on Honeycomb. I wanted to avoid overused storage tropes such as clouds and boxes, in hopes it would make my product stand out more.</p>
        <p>After exploring my logo options through sketches and digital renderings, I picked a simple logo and type treatment for a straightforward and contemporary mark.</p>

        <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/honeycomb-logo-full.png" alt="finished version of logo"/>
        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
          <h4>Primary Colors</h4>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/primary-colors.png" alt="goldenrod and lavender"/>
          <h4>Secondary Colors</h4>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/secondary-colors.png" alt="poppy, sage, and sky"/>
          <h4>Neutrals</h4>
            <img src="images/Honeycomb Case Study Images/neutrals.png" alt="neutral grey and off-black"/>
          <p>Honeycomb’s color palette was inspired by a field of wildflowers. The primary color palette of lavender and goldenrod were meant to convey happiness, optimism and calm.</p>
        <h3>Typography<h3>
          <h4 class="mermaid">Mermaid</h4>
            <p class="mermaid">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz1234567890</p>
          <h4 class="dm-sans">DM Sans Regular</h4>

        <h3>Second Round User Testing<h3>
          <h4>What I tested</h4>
            <p>For the second round of testing I asked users to log in, upgrade their accounds to premium, and create a folder.</p>
          <h4>What I learned<h4>
            <p>All assigned tasks were completed correctly by users.  Some small tweaks were called for in order to make some elements even more obcious and clear.</p>
          <h4>Changes I made to my design<h4>
            <p>For the final mockups, I changed a few things, including changing the fill color of the New icon to make it stand out even more, adding a scroll indicator to the homepage, and  changed the CTA links on the homepage into buttons.</p>

              <figcaption>(Left) Before testing, I had the “New” icon a neutral grey, after (right) I changed it to a gradient of the Honeycomb palette.</figcaption>

              <figcaption>(Left) Before, the CTAs on the homepage were plain links, after (right) I changed these to buttons to make them more obvious.</figcaption>

              <figcaption>(Left) Before, there was no visual indicator to users that they should scroll through the homepage so I added the bee trail element (right) to cue my users to keep scrolling.</figcaption>

      <h2>Final Insights</h2>
        <p>This project touched on many aspects of the design process, and it was gratifying to take something from idea to finished prototype. In some ways I feel that I was successful in delivering a product to my users that solved a problem they were having. </p>
        <p>With every success, however, comes failure. If I could have done anything differently, I would have spent more time on the sketching portion of this project. Sketches are  invaluabe tools that make the difference between something that works alright, and something that is truly inspired. I also succumbed to scope creep in my design. My intent was to give my users all of the features they wanted (like having customized storage solutions), but these were determined to be low priority features for the MVP. The result was a prototype with underdeveloped visual and functional components. The overall design would have been more effective had I stuck to my high priority stories and ditched my original idea.</p>
        <p>I am happy with the design I came up with, and users reported that they enjoyed the UI, but am sure that future iterations could be even better.</p>
